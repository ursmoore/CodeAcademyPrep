  <p>Below you find a short list of things that can be considered pillars of my personality</p>

  <ul>
      <li>I am quite pessimistic about the world</li>
      <li>However I am optimistic about myself</li>
      <li>I have misanthropic tendencies in private</li>
      <li>But camouflage them with sarcasm and irony in public</li>
      <li>Next to making art I love food and literature (mainly sleazy paperbacks) and I like a walk in the park</li>
      <li>One of my favourite booktitles is Cioran's "The trouble with being born"</li>
      <li>...</li>
  </ul>
